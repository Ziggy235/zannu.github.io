	<p><b> Everyone can use a little encouragement now and then. Sadly, both inner struggles and external setbacks are an unavoidable part of
		 being human. The good news is we don’t have to leave someone we care about to muddle through alone. We can be the ones to write
		 the words or send the laugh in an encouragement card that helps someone through a rough day or a whole tough season of life.

		If the difficulty of someone’s situation has you feeling stumped about what to say, keep reading. In the rest of this article, you’ll
		 find ideas for adding your own personal message to an encouragement card. We’ve organized these ideas by situation or need, and
		  included writing tips and examples throughout. We hope these help
		 you deliver a little light and support when they’re needed most.</b></p>
